> This repository is for the **colori-demo** website. There's a [separate one for the colori module](https://github.com/Remiscan/colori).

This is the source code for the demonstration website [remiscan.fr/colori/](https://remiscan.fr/colori/).

The demo website lets you type a valid color expression in an input field, and automatically converts it into all CSS-supported formats. The interface changes color based on user input.

It also lets you test functions from **colori.js**, like modifying or blending colors, directly in that same input field.
